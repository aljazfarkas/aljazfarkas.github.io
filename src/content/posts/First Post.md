Welcome to my blog! This is a blog where I complain about lazy strength players in Elden ring, that are too afraid to use their brains and think.

## The problem

The first thing that comes to mind is that the game is too easy.
They just bonk bonk.
Then comes brainrot.
No strategy, no thinking, just bonk.

## The solution

The solution is simple.
Use your brain.
Think.
Plan.
Faith.

Fin.

<small>P.S. Dmytro, I hope you don't brainrot too much.</small>
